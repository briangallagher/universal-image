I need to create a new image in the universal image folder. 

This image will use the @workbench-image/ as the base image. I'm not sure where this is published yet. The @runtime-image/ contains all the dependancies required for the universal image. Essentially, I need to combine this images into a single image. 

This single universal image will run in 2 contexts. One is as a "workbench-image" essentially this means that the behaviour, startup etc should behave identically to that in @workbench-image/. It will simply have additional dependancies from the runtime image. Regardless is should startup and launch in the same way. The second context will be as a runtime image. In this context it should follow the entrypoint / startup logic in the @runtime-image/ 
The default behaviour of the image should be that of the @workbench-image/ and an environment variable should be used to switch it's behaviour to the runtime context. This will allow switching this new image directly for the current @workbench-image/ without any changes to the deployment environment etc.

Evaluate this design/strategy in terms of pros / cons / risks etc

There will be overlapping and possibly conflicting dependancies. The dependancies might be RPMs, binaries, python packages etc. 
I want to catalog all of these. Create at least 3 summary text files under the universal-image folder. 1 for RPMs one of binaries and one for python packages. In each file list the dependancies for each image and their version, then list the differences / conlficts, then detail suggestions to resolve these differences. Are there any other categories of dependancies that should be consider. 
In cases where there are duplicates, the dependancies should be removed from the universal-image and it should instead just rely on the dependancies provided by the workbench base image. We don't have control of the workbench image so this needs to remain as is and we can only make modifications within the new universal image. This is a fundamental principal. 

Are there any other aspects I should consider for this project? 

Ask any clarifying questions before proceeding with any suggestions in order to maximise the quality of the response given 

Write this and all following prompts and results to a prompts.txt file under the universal-image. 

[2025-09-25T00:00:00Z] ASSISTANT:
Created initial dependency catalogs (lists and diffs) and logging. Suggestions will follow after answers to clarifying questions below.
[2025-09-25T00:00:01Z] ASSISTANT:
Clarifying questions before recommendations:
1) Exact base image reference for workbench: registry, repository, tag/digest, and target stage (e.g., cuda-jupyter-pytorch)?
2) Architectures to support: linux/amd64 only, or also linux/arm64?
3) Expected runtime entrypoint: what command/script should "runtime mode" execute (current runtime Dockerfile shows no ENTRYPOINT)?
4) CUDA/Torch policy: base has torch 2.7.1+cu128; runtime needs torch 2.8.0 and flash-attn 2.8.3. Should universal image pin to base torch (preferred per your principle) and drop runtime pins, or is upgrading base torch acceptable?
5) Driver floor: runtime sets NVIDIA_REQUIRE_CUDA and CUDA compat to 570.172.08. Do we need to preserve these exact constraints?
6) External repos allowed: okay to add NVIDIA CUDA and Mellanox OFED repos in universal image like runtime does? Any mirrors/proxies to use?
7) OS package policy: are we allowed to add new dnf packages beyond base? Any forbidden packages?
8) Jupyter behavior parity: should universal image exactly replicate workbench Jupyter UX (addons, Elyra, lab extensions), including the same ENTRYPOINT and env vars?
9) Image size constraints: any maximum image size or layer count we must meet?
10) Publication target: where should the universal image be published (registry/repo/tags), and do you require SBOM/signing?
11) Networking/build constraints: any offline builds, air-gapped registries, or restricted egress during build/runtime?
12) Additional dependency categories to catalog: kernel modules/OFED drivers, fonts/locale, CA certs, sysctl limits, NCCL tuning envsâ€”should these be tracked too?
13) Acceptance tests: what commands validate each mode (workbench vs runtime) is healthy?
14) Config toggle name: confirm env var (e.g., UNIVERSAL_MODE=runtime|workbench) and default=workbench.

[2025-09-25T00:02:00Z] USER:
Minimal should contain cuda 12.8 - double check this. The Dockerfile to reference is Dockerfile.cuda in the minimal folder

[2025-09-25T00:02:00Z] ASSISTANT:
Confirmed minimal inherits CUDA 12.8 from BASE_IMAGE (v12.8). Updated catalogs to reflect this.
[2025-09-25T00:03:00Z] USER:

[2025-09-25T00:12:00Z] USER:
Flash attention is mandatory

[2025-09-25T00:12:00Z] ASSISTANT:
Enforced FA as mandatory (amd64-only) in Dockerfile and updated design decisions.
[2025-09-25T00:13:00Z] USER:
can you tell from the minimal folder what cpu arch it supports? The Dockerfile.cuda

[2025-09-25T00:13:00Z] ASSISTANT:
The Dockerfile itself doesn't declare platforms; arch support is determined by the BASE_IMAGE. Inspect the base tags to see which arches are published.
[2025-09-25T00:14:00Z] USER:
Will docker pull look at my current system architecture and pull the image based on that?

[2025-09-25T00:14:00Z] ASSISTANT:
Yes. If the tag has a multi-arch manifest, Docker pulls the image matching your host platform (e.g., arm64 on Apple Silicon, amd64 on x86). You can override with --platform (e.g., docker pull --platform linux/amd64 <image>:tag). If only one arch is published, Docker either uses emulation (if available) or fails.
[2025-09-25T00:15:00Z] USER:
how to check is an image has multi-arch manifest

[2025-09-25T00:15:00Z] ASSISTANT:
Commands to inspect multi-arch manifests will follow.
[2025-09-25T00:16:00Z] USER:
Why is it building --platform linux/arm64 ? Shouldn't it just try to build amd64?

[2025-09-25T00:16:00Z] ASSISTANT:
Updated build script so PUSH=false respects LOAD_PLATFORM or first PLATFORMS value; use LOAD_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 to force amd64 on Mac.
[2025-09-25T00:17:00Z] USER:
Will it be possible for me to test on the Mac after building that image?

[2025-09-25T00:17:00Z] ASSISTANT:
Yes: build/load amd64 locally (emulated), run local scripts; GPU-only features must be validated on Kubernetes with GPUs.

How does the torch and flash attention compare to the runtime image method

[2025-09-25T00:18:00Z] ASSISTANT:
Universal installs torch via PyTorch cu128 index in its own RUN, then installs flash-attn from PyPI (no-build-isolation), enforcing amd64. Runtime installed deps via micropipenv (Pipfile.lock with pytorch-cu128), then separately pip-installed flash-attn and NVIDIA cu12.8 wheels. Versions match (torch 2.8.0, FA 2.8.3), but universal uses pip-only without a lock file; runtime used a lock for reproducibility and also added extra nvidia-* wheels.
[2025-09-25T00:19:00Z] USER:
is FA only available on amd64?

[2025-09-25T00:19:00Z] ASSISTANT:
For flash-attn 2.8.3, prebuilt wheels target Linux x86_64 with CUDA; official arm64 wheels are not published. Arm64 generally requires building from source with nvcc and matching CUDA/torch, which we are not enabling in this image.
[2025-09-25T00:20:00Z] USER:
so currently our Dockerfile only support amd64? Does the runtime support both?

[2025-09-25T00:20:00Z] ASSISTANT:
Universal Dockerfile: amd64-only (FlashAttention mandatory). Runtime Dockerfile: effectively amd64-only too (CUDA repo URL hardcoded to x86_64 and FA wheels). Arm64 would require an arm64 base, aarch64 CUDA/OFED repos, and building FA from source.
[2025-09-25T00:21:00Z] USER:
What is flash attention

[2025-09-25T00:21:00Z] ASSISTANT:
FlashAttention is a collection of fused CUDA kernels implementing an IO-aware, tiled attention algorithm for Transformers. It minimizes reads/writes to HBM, keeping blocks in fast on-chip memory (SRAM/shared), which reduces memory bandwidth bottlenecks and enables longer sequence lengths with lower memory use and higher throughput. In practice it speeds up attention in training/inference (often 2-4x on A100/H100) versus naive attention, with support for causal mask, dropout, backward, and variants like FlashAttention-2 and GQA. It requires specific Torch/CUDA versions and GPUs with recent SM architectures; prebuilt wheels are typically Linux x86_64 with CUDA, hence our amd64 enforcement.
