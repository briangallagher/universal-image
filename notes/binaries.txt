Binary/executable artifacts catalog

Image: minimal-wb-image (base)
- CUDA 12.8 toolchain/runtime inherited from BASE_IMAGE
- oc (OpenShift CLI) — downloaded from OCP stable; version not pinned in Dockerfile
- Jupyter startup script: start-notebook.sh (ENTRYPOINT)
- PDF export tooling via utils/install_pdf_deps.sh (likely texlive, pandoc binaries)

Image: runtime-image (additional tooling)
- CUDA toolchain binaries via pinned RPMs (e.g., nvcc 12.8.61, cudart 12.8.57) — ensure alignment with base CUDA 12.8

Overlaps and potential conflicts
- CUDA 12.8 exists in base; avoid duplicating or conflicting versions from runtime layer.
- No oc in runtime; minimal provides oc.

Constraints and requirements
- Preserve NVIDIA driver requirement env per runtime (NVIDIA_REQUIRE_CUDA).
- Follow runtime’s current approach to external repos and tool versions.

Notes
- ENTRYPOINT/COMMAND will be provided by the runtime platform at execution time per requirement; universal image should not rely on a fixed ENTRYPOINT when used in runtime mode.
